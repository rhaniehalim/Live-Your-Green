# Live-Your-Green

We built this application as a team of three. We were discussing ideas and realized they all centered around how to be a better environmental steward. We came up with the idea for Live Your Green as a result of our brainstorming. This application provides a personalized user experience with a secure login and user dashboard. 

Once inside the application, the user can use the carbon footprint calculator to see how their daily habits stack up to the average user. After evaluating current energy use and improving their footprint with the Live Your Green resources, a user can use the resources section to find local recycling resources instead of sending items to the landfill.   

We used Sequelize to build a MySQL database to hold our user data and carbon footprint result data. To build out the carbon footprint calculator and survey, we developed a numeric calculation using jQuery and then built routes to send a user's footprint result to our database. Recycling resources were added using an API call to Earth911. Our plans for future versions include more customization in the user dashboard, social functionality and location mapping to the recycling resources for a better user experience.
